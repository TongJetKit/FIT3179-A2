            as the happiest country</strong>. Then followed by New Zealand then Australia. Finland has secure its 1st
            place ranking due to various factors like:   
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Creating a well-established healthcare system, public education system</li>

            For Malaysia, our ranking <strong>rose to 4th place in 2016</strong> but then dropped
            <strong>tremendously in 2019</strong>. However, in 2023 we were able to secure 6th place. 
            There is a tremendous decline due to:
            <ol>
                <li>Relatively high crime rate in Southeast Asia(68%) according to the World Crime Rate Ranking</li>
                <li>High number of reports of environmental pollution in various parts of Malaysia especially in water pollution</li>

          <p>
            From the scatterplots, we can see a positive relation between Happiness Score and

          <p>
            As the factors increase, the happiness index score increase as well. It is evident that these factors are the prime
            reason that a country's happiness score increase. This is because as a country's econmony gets better, more freedom 
            are given to the people, better healthcare and having a supportive society, the well-being and lifestyle of person will increase.
            Hence, the people will be more happier as their life is more better. 

          </p>
           <p>
            However, for the Generosity, there is not much correlation between it and the Happiness Score. This is because in this 
            economy, there is not much people who would donate. Moreover, Happiness vary in people, some might find happiness within generosity 
            while others may find happiness in other places. Finally, with the increasing number of fraud cases over the years, people are vary of each
            other and the lack of trust may cause distaste among the community.

                        It contributes to the happiness index score as without freedom people will feel sad as they do not feel like they have
                        control over their life and be part of some acomplishment. Therefore, by providing freedom to the people, 
                        they generally feel happy as they feel like they are capable of acheiveing something.

                    <h2>When Integrity Falters, Happiness Suffers: The Impact of Corruption</h2>
                    <p>
                        Perception of corruption is about the perceived correption level of a public sector.
                        It reflects on the trust between public officials and the community. When citizens perceive 
                        that their government is corrupt, it can lead to a lack of trust in society, 
                        including trust in other people. Trust and social capital are essential components of happiness, 
                        as they contribute to a sense of security and well-being. A low level of perception of corruption means a high in trust,
                        which in turn increase happiness as people are assured that the govenrment will not undermine them by 
                        engaging in corrupt practices that will affect the peaceful and comfortable life they have.
                        Moreover, corruption also undermines the principles of justice and fairness. Injustice will then be perceived 
                        as a negative immpact on happiness and overall life extectancy. 

                        Finland typically ranks at or near the top of Transparency International's CPI, 
                        which assesses perceived levels of public sector corruption in countries worldwide. 
                        This is due to the fact that Finland's govenrment are transparent and fair so they can maintain
                        integrity and prevent any corrupt practices. Finland also implemented anti-corruption methods to maintain their
                        integrity as well. Furthermore, with the freedom of media, media companies play a crucial role in exposing corruption.
                        Thus, it has contributed in maintaining a low corruption level.

            <h2>Is Happiness Skewed?</h2>
            <p>
                From the chart on the right, it is evident that GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy are the prima donnas for affecting the
                happiness index score. This is because nowadays <strong>health and wealth</strong> are the most important things in life.
                With those anyone will be happy.
            </p>

            <p>
            
                It is especially clear in Western Europe Countries. Western Europe is home to many <strong> developed countries 
                with strong and diverse economies</strong>. This includes nations like Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and 
                the Nordic countries, which have high GDP per capita. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A strong economy allows for investment in <strong>healthcare, 
                education, infrastructure, and social welfare programs</strong> that contribute to overall well-being. With a strong economy 
                Western Europe countries can then provide <strong>universal healthcare</strong> to their citizens, ensuring them to have access to medical care
                regardless of their income status which will lead to a higher life expectancy. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Moreover, Western Europe place a <strong>strong emphasis in the education sector</strong>. They have provided many innovations and
                improvement to the education system so that its of high-quality. Thus, Western Europe citizens can acheive a higher earning potential 
                and overall well-being which then in turn boost their country's GDP. 
                The region has also experienced <strong>political stability and peace since the end of World War II</strong>. 
                This stability has allowed for economic growth and the development of social systems which means that their citizens
                are happy as they are living in a harmonius and peaceful life.
